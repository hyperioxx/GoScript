# GoScript


GoScript is a unique project initiated during my exploration of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). The core idea behind GoScript is to develop a statically typed, interpreted language that incorporates the essence of Go (Golang) in terms of syntax and features.


Objectives:

- Statically Typed Language: Ensuring type safety and minimizing runtime errors by incorporating static typing, a key aspect of languages like Go.

- Interpreted with Performance: Striking a balance between being an interpreted language and maintaining performance on par with other languages in its category.

- Golang-Inspired Syntax and Features: Adopting a syntax and feature set that resonates with Golang, making it familiar and intuitive for those accustomed to Golang.

- Compiler and Virtual Machine Integration: Similar to Python, GoScript is designed with its own compiler and virtual machine, facilitating efficient execution and offering flexibility in usage.
